The project uses some excerpts from the code located at the following websites:

The project above states an "Open Source" format, but neglects to include a license.
Therefore all code used from this source is clearly marked should you choose to ignore it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Much of the code is incomplete or undergoes constant change, a final product is not yet in sight.
Running the code may require additional installs such as:
https://github.com/kyrus/python-junit-xml
which in turn requires
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
or a derivative to install.

Commands to declare and compile libraries for the AES test project are not included
but can be extracted from the makefile included in the AES folder, or you can run the makefile.
